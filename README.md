# Mobile-UHF-RFID-Reader-Project-Chafon-Raspberry-Pi
UHF RFID Mobile Mesh

This project is to develope an RFID tracking system that utilizes everyday movement to track inventory. 

Goal: Program Middle Ware to comminucate with Chafon CF-5306 RFID Reader. I will be using a Raspberry Pi 4 as the brains of the operation. I would like the Middleware to capture Tag ID and pair it with GPS location from a G-Mouse USB. I would then like the Raspberry Pi to communicated [Tag ID, GPS Coordinates, Time] to a remote Database. 

I will need help, thank you for your help.
